    "2. **Empirical priors.** \n",
    "Empirical Priors are priors which are actually posteriors from previous studies of the same phenomenon. For example, it's common in Supernova cosmology studies to use the WMAP results as a prior: that is, to actually plug-in a *real result* and use the new data to improve on that. This situation is where Bayesian approaches really shine.  For the linear fit, you might imagine that the $x, y$ data is a more accurate version of a previous experiment, where we've found that the intercept is $\\theta_0 = 50 \\pm 30$ and the slope is $\\theta_1 = 1.0 \\pm 0.5$.\n",

The problem is that flat priors are not always non-informative! For example, a flat prior on the slope will effectively give a higher weight to larger slopes.\n",

    "Similar in spirit is the commonly-used [Jeffreys Prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffreys_prior), which in many cases of interest amounts to a \"scale invariant\" prior: a flat prior on the logarithm of the parameter.\n",
    "In the case of the linear slope, we often want a prior which does not artificially over-weight large slopes: there are a couple possible approaches to this (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5018 for some discussion). For our situation, we might use a flat prior on the angle the line makes with the x-axis, which gives\n",
