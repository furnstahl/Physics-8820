    "### Applying the Bayesian approach\n",
    "Leaving these philosophical debates aside for the time being, let's address how Bayesian results are generally computed in practice. For a one parameter problem like the one considered here, it's as simple as computing the posterior probability $p(\\mu,\\sigma~|~D,I)$ as a function of $\\mu,\\sigma$: this is the distribution reflecting our knowledge of the parameter $\\mu,\\sigma$. But as the dimension of the model grows, this direct approach becomes increasingly intractable. For this reason, Bayesian calculations often depend on sampling methods such as [Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo). \n",
    "\n",
    "We won't go into the details of the theory of MCMC here (again, we will be discussing this topic during the course). Instead we will show a practical example of applying an MCMC approach using Dan Foreman-Mackey's excellent [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/)  package.  Keep in mind here that the goal is to *generate a set of points drawn from the posterior probability distribution*, and to use those points to determine the answer we seek.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this MCMC, we start by defining Python functions for the prior $p(\\mu,\\sigma~|~I)$, the likelihood $p(D~|~\\mu,\\sigma, I)$, and the posterior $p(\\mu,\\sigma~|~D,I)$, noting that none of these need be properly normalized. Our model here is two-dimensional so we'll define the model in terms of an array of parameters $\\theta$, which in this case is $\\theta = [\\mu,\\sigma]$:"

The two plots on the diagonal show marginalized distributions (with one parameter integrated out) for the two model parameters. The blue lines indicate the *true* values of the model parameters, while the title and the dashed lines indicate the most probable value as well as a 68% confidence interval. We will be discussing these representative measures of a posterior distribution during the course. \n",

    "Now, you might come away with the impression that the Bayesian method is unnecessarily complicated, and in this case it certainly is. Using an Affine Invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo Ensemble sampler to characterize a two-dimensional normal distribution is a bit like using the Death Star to destroy a beach ball, but we did this here because it demonstrates an approach that can scale to complicated posteriors in many, many dimensions, and can provide nice results in more complicated situations where an analytic likelihood approach is not possible."
